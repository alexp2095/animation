     <h1>Animation</h1>
     <h2>Zombie</h2>
     <h3>Movement for Classical Renewal Manifesto 2002</h3>
   </header>

   <p>In order for the zombie animation to work, I had to find a zombie image that had all the frames combined into one photo. Once I found one,
   I had to set the width and height in order for the website to show only one frame, instead of the entire sprite sheet. Then I added the margins,
   to center it properly within the page. I then added the url of the zombie to the background and adjusted it to left center.</p>
   <p>After, I added the keyframe named play that would animate the background until it reached the end (-2000px). Then I bound the play animation
   sequence to the zombie selector. I then added the .8s, which means the duration of the animation. Then I added steps(10) in order to change the
   scrolling effect into an actual animation that went through each frame. After, I placed infinite in order to make the animation repeat continuously.</p>
   <p>The reason as to why I chose a zombie as an animation to represent the manifesto was because it claimed that the classical art was slowly dying
   and being replaced by conceptualism and modernism. Because of this, I wanted to represent the dying movement as a zombie.</p>
